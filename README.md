# trainschedules
This uses firebase to store information about trains and when they will arrive to the station.  You can add a train name, destination, first arrival, and the frequency.  When you submit this information it will append to the top in the current train div and will add all the information about the train to the firebase and will update the minutes away colunm with a number value showing how many minutes away the train you just entered.  You can also modify train information from the firebase and add or delete it.  Some things I could have done to make this better would be adding a delete button on the scheduler itself instead of having to go to the firebase and delete it from there.  I also want to make the minutes away actually update instead of being static and not changing.
